Subject: RE: C-Irrig program change

Hi Jeff,
Yes, I can meet up with you maybe Fri or Mon.  I might even be able to 
stop by your office on Fri.

I think that since it sounds like we'll eventually want more than one PLC, 
we should change the agent now to allow that.

It also sounds like you want my option 3 -- a script that automatically 
stores the cirrig inputs and outputs to a database table every day for 
every zone regardless of whether that zone is selected to be automated for 
irrigation purposes.  I'm assuming that you would just want the 
"Infrequently changing inputs" not "Fixed inputs" to be stored?  As well 
as of course the outputs displayed on the table on the cirrig page.

As far as actual vs scheduled irrigation, I'll think about that, perhaps 
after an irrigation, the PLC agent can send a command back to the CCrop 
agent to tell it the actual irrigation time and have it update a table?

Craig

But with cirrig we have introduced zones, which makes it more complex since in realtime we only had one run that could be automated.  The ccrop agent runs the driver program on that run every morning and updates the runs table with the current day of year and all the irrigation results.

You enable all 3 zones to have the cirrig calculations performed automatically and saved to a database at 5am every morning.  You have two copies of the PLC agent running, one on our server, one on a machine that can see the two PLCs at the nursery.  You can run the PLC GUI from anywhere for the UF zone, but it will have to be on a computer that can see the machine where the PLC agent is running at the nursery for the other two.  If that machine has a public IP address, it can be anywhere too.  You configure both GUIs and assign the zones to the PLCs.  At say 6am, both PLC agents connect to the CCrop agent, get the irrigation values for the proper zones, and send the commands to the proper PLCs.

Then I'll be skiing in CO the 20th-24th and home for a few days after that.  I'll be back here the 28th-29th and since UF will be closed, I'll have plenty of time to work on stuff then too.
