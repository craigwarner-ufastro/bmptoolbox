	<BR>
		<BR>
	<DT>CIRRIG was converted to a mobile application with funding provided by Florida Nursery, Growers and Landscape Association and the Southwest Florida Water Management District.</DT>
	<BR>
	<FONT COLOR="#00b050"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Pages</B></FONT></FONT><DT>
	<BR>
	<DT>The CIRRIG app has three main pages: Title, Irrigation, and Weather.
	<DT><BR>
	<DT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Title Page</B></FONT></FONT><DT>
	The title page is briefly displayed when the app starts and new weather data is being downloaded. The title page transitions to the irrigation page once the download is complete.<DT>
	<BR>
	<DT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Irrigation Page</B></FONT></FONT><DT>
	The irrigation page displays the current inputs or settings used to generate the irrigation run time displayed on the page.
	The irrigation run time is calculated the same as the website version of CIRRIG and is based on FAWN (Florida Automated Weather Network) weather from the past 24 hours.
	The FAWN weather station can be selected from a pulldown list on the 24-hour weather page or the nearest station can be automatically identified using GPS.</DT>
    <BR />
	<DT>
		The user can change one or more of the settings.  Once changed, settings are persistent until changed again.
	</DT>
    <BR />
    <DT>
	<B>Container diameter (inch) </B> – Containers come in a range of diameters so the user can input the actual top diameter of containers used in the nursery.
	The app was built for containers with diameters less than 12 inches.
	<DT>
	<BR />
	<DT><B>Spacing (inch between)</B> – There is no one spacing all growers use when containers are spaced. The user can input the spacing typically used in the nursery.
		Measure the average distance between the top outer edges of adjacent containers.   For containers arranged in the offset pattern,
		measure the distance between containers along the axis parallel with plant production beds and measure the distance between containers diagonally to the previous measurement.
		Enter the average for the two measurements.
	</DT>
	<BR />
	<DT>
		<B>Spacing arrangement </B>
		(offset or square) - Containers placed in a square arrangement are equal distance from each other, whereas the offset pattern resembles a triangle.
	</DT>
	<BR/>
	<DT>
		<B>Plant width (inch)</B>
		- widest canopy width is averaged with perpendicular width.
	</DT>
	<BR/>
	<DT>
		<B>Canopy density </B>
		- Plant canopy density is used to describe the compactness of the foliage.  Loose, open plant canopies have a low density and well-shaped, tight canopies have a high density.
		Plant canopy density and plant width are used to estimate the amount of leaf surfaces that directly affect the rate of evapotranspiration (water loss).
	</DT>
	<BR />
	<DT>
		<B>Irrigation rate (inch/hour) </B>
		- The depth of water per unit of time is determined for the area irrigated.
	</DT>
	<BR />
	<DT>
	<B>Irrigation capture ability</B> - select the icon that best describes the plant’s ability to capture irrigation water. The icons correspond to the options on the website version of CIRRIG.
	</DT>
	<BR />
	<DT><IMG SRC="capture_negative.png"> = “Neg”,  
	<IMG SRC="capture_nil.png"> = “Nil”, 
	<IMG SRC="capture_low.png"> = “Low”, 
	<IMG SRC="capture_medium.png"> = “Med”, 
	<IMG SRC="capture_high.png"> = “High”</DL>
<P>
<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>If the water-capturing ability of the plant is unknown, selecting “nil” or “low” will provide more conservative (higher) irrigation recommendations.</P>

	<DT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Weather Page</B></FONT></FONT><DT>
	Click on the run time button and the daily weather page displays weather each day for the past six days. Weather data for the past 24 hours are specifically
	used for the irrigation run time displayed on the irrigation page. User may also enter weather data using weather override.
	</DT>
	<BR />
	<DT>
	The weather override can be very useful when the rain at the nursery during the past 24 hours was different than at the FAWN station.
	For example, if it rained at the nursery but not at the FAWN station, enter the depth of rain that was beneficial.
	If it rained early in the past 24 hours, before significant plant water loss, you might consider not inputting this rain whereas if rain fell late in the day you would.
