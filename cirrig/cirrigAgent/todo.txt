 -> 1 x PLC class with many PLCOutlet objects
 -> Zone class contains PLCOutlet index
 -> Group class contains PLC class and Zones 

 -> Apply settings to global, group, or zone
 -> Add group feature


BMPJEC connects to CCropAgent, reads zone info
ZoneRow panel class within GroupPanels
AddGroupPanel, EditGroupPanel

Zones added to ArrayDeque for irrigation

Group class contains scheduler and is set to hour/minute
But can have multiple start times so multiple schedulerers?

ZoneGroup has a toXML() method and can be created from XML node
After every change to a ZoneGroup or add/delete of one, XML is updated

PLC -> ArrayList of ZoneGroups
PLC -> Array of Outlets
PLC -> LinkedHashMap? Outlets->Zones
ZoneGroup -> ArrayList of Zones
PLC -> GetFreeOutlets?
Convert outlet number to name, e.g. Y00

Commands:
ADD_ZONE_GROUP::groupName
DELETE_ZONE_GROUP::groupName

ADD_OUTLET_TO_ZONE_GROUP::groupName::outletNum
REMOVE_OUTLET_FROM_ZONE_GROUP::groupName::outletNum
GET_FREE_OUTLETS::plc => double loop over outlets and zonegroup.isOutletInUse

SET_ZONE::groupName::outletNum


ZoneGroup => ArrayList of ZoneOutlets!  Each ZoneOutlet contains CirrigOutlet, Zone, priority, irrig value

ZoneGroup has ncycles cycles and ncycles start times.  Sorted by time.
TaskScheduler runs ncycles tasks.

At each time to irrigate, readyToIrrigate=True and cycleNumber incremented.
This is seen by CirrigPlcAgent IrrigPollingThread and added to ArrayDeque
(synchronize).  First cycle of the day, task downloads irrig values from
CCropAgent and updates Zone.  If that fails, it tries localhost for weather
with current Zone info.

On SET_ZONE, current Zone also downloaded.
